<p>
  My "write a game in 24 hours challenge" done with JavaScript to learn the language. 
  Please don't read the code. ğŸ’€
</p>

<p>
 The gameplay is simple: buy guns, upgrade guns, shoot bubbles to proceed.
 Bubbles will get exponentially stronger, and the game goes on endlessly until you run out of lives.
 On a second thought, they probably get stronger at a polynomial rate, but the game's name is already stuck as is.
 The bubbles divide though, so their numbers do exponentially increase.
</p>

<p>
  This eventually becomes my another game dev project "EXPBBL", which I might expand on even further in the far future.
  A lot more features including multiplayer coming in the future for this game as well.
