# Exponentiation Bubbles
My "write a game in 24 hours challenge" done with JavaScript to learn the language.

Play the [game](https://pyxidata.github.io/exponentiation-bubbles/).

The game is really simple and self-explanatory, but if you want some instructions:

  * Pop bubbles with your gun.
  * Avoid getting hit by bubbles.
  * If you clear all the bubbles, you will automatically progress to the next round.
  
  - You can upgrade your character, buy new guns, and upgrade guns with coins.
  - Bigger bubbles can divide more. They also have exponentially higher HP and damage.

Don't read into the code though. I wrote this during final exam week and everything is
rushed and spaghettificated.
